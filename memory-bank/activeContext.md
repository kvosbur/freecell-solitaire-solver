# Active Context: Current Cross-Component Work and Priorities

## Current Work Focus
**Primary Task**: Monorepo memory bank structure and navigation strategy

**Status**: ‚úÖ **COMPLETED** - Consolidated memory bank architecture successfully implemented and optimized

## Recent Changes
- ‚úÖ Updated root `.clinerules` with monorepo-specific navigation strategy
- ‚úÖ Created root `memory-bank/` directory structure
- ‚úÖ Implemented `projectbrief.md` with monorepo overview
- ‚úÖ Implemented `workspaceContext.md` with component relationships
- ‚úÖ Implemented `activeContext.md` with current priorities
- ‚úÖ Implemented `progress.md` with workspace-wide status
- ‚úÖ Removed duplicate `.clinerules` files from `/game/` and `/game-engine/`
- ‚úÖ Optimized component memory banks to focus on component-specific details
- ‚úÖ Moved workspace-wide concerns from components to root memory bank

## Next Steps
- **game-engine v0.2.0 Refactoring**: Implement the refined API design focusing on a pure game engine.
    1.  **Enhanced Error System**: Implement a rich `GameError` that preserves full context from component-specific errors.
    2.  **Type-Safe Locations**: Introduce a validated `Location` struct for all game areas, ensuring type safety and preventing invalid indices.
    3.  **Clean Move System**: Redesign the `Move` struct to be type-safe and focused solely on game mechanics, removing solver-specific metadata.
    4.  **Focused GameState API**: Streamline the `GameState` API, ensuring all methods are core to game rules and mechanics, and provide consistent `Result`-based return types.
    5.  **Component Interface Refinement**: Ensure all component methods (`Tableau`, `FreeCells`, `Foundations`) return `Result` for all fallible operations, providing consistent error handling.
- **Documentation Update**: Thoroughly update all API documentation to reflect the new design and provide clear migration guides.
- **Testing**: Ensure comprehensive test coverage for all new and modified APIs.

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Memory Bank Navigation Strategy
**Decision Made**: Three-tier hierarchy approach
- **Tier 1**: Root memory bank for workspace overview
- **Tier 2**: Component memory banks for detailed context
- **Tier 3**: Navigation files (`.clinerules`, `WORKSPACE_GUIDE.md`)

**Context Loading Rules**:
- Component-specific work: Start with root `activeContext.md`, then component memory bank
- Cross-component work: Read entire root memory bank first
- Unknown scope: Always start with root `activeContext.md`

### Current Development Priority
**Active Component**: game-engine (v0.2.0 API Refinement)
- Building a pure, focused game engine library
- Priority: Complete the breaking changes for v0.2.0

## Important Patterns and Preferences

### Monorepo Organization
- **Shared Library Pattern**: game-engine as foundation for all applications
- **Clear Boundaries**: Each component has focused responsibility
- **Workspace Consistency**: Unified build, test, and development patterns
- **Memory Bank Efficiency**: Avoid reading unnecessary context

### Development Approach
- **Foundation-First**: Complete game-engine refactoring before building applications
- **Integration-Aware**: Consider cross-component impacts
- **Documentation-Driven**: Memory banks guide all development decisions
- **Iterative Progress**: Build working increments across components

## Learnings and Project Insights

### Monorepo Memory Bank Strategy
- **Context Overload Risk**: Reading all memory banks creates information overload
- **Navigation Importance**: Root `activeContext.md` serves as compass
- **Scope-Based Loading**: Different strategies for different work types
- **Consolidation Benefits**: Single `.clinerules` eliminates duplication

### Component Relationships
- **game-engine**: Stable foundation, affects all consumers
- **solver**: Depends on game-engine, next priority after game-engine refactoring
- **appAutomation**: Future integration phase

### Workspace Health
- ‚úÖ All components compile successfully
- ‚úÖ Shared library pattern working correctly
- ‚úÖ Clear dependency relationships established
- üîÑ Memory bank structure being optimized
- ‚è≥ Cross-component testing patterns needed

## Cross-Component Considerations

### API Stability
- Changes to game-engine require coordination across consumers
- Maintain backward compatibility when possible
- Document breaking changes clearly

### Integration Points
- **solver + game-engine**: State validation, Move generation
- **appAutomation + solver**: Solution format compatibility

### Testing Strategy
- Component-level unit tests
- Integration tests through game-engine
- Workspace-wide build and compatibility tests

## Memory Bank Status

### Root Memory Bank - COMPLETE ‚úÖ
- ‚úÖ `projectbrief.md` - Monorepo vision and architecture
- ‚úÖ `workspaceContext.md` - Component relationships
- ‚úÖ `activeContext.md` - Current priorities and focus
- ‚úÖ `progress.md` - Workspace-wide status and roadmap

### Component Memory Banks - OPTIMIZED ‚úÖ
- ‚úÖ `/game-engine/memory-bank/` - Focused on library architecture and patterns
- ‚è≥ `/solver/memory-bank/` - To be created when needed

### Navigation Files - COMPLETE ‚úÖ
- ‚úÖ `/.clinerules` - Updated with monorepo strategy
- ‚úÖ `/WORKSPACE_GUIDE.md` - Technical workspace information
- ‚úÖ Removed duplicate `.clinerules` from components

## Notes for Future Sessions
- **Start Here**: Always read this file first to understand current focus
- **Component Work**: Check if work is component-specific or cross-component
- **Memory Bank Navigation**: Follow the established three-tier strategy
- **Current Priority**: Complete game-engine v0.2.0 API Refinement
- **Integration Awareness**: Consider cross-component impacts for all changes
