# Active Context: Current Cross-Component Work and Priorities

## Current Work Focus
**Primary Task**: Interface Consistency for Core Game Components

**Status**: ‚úÖ **COMPLETED** ‚Äì FreeCells, Foundations, and Tableau now follow a consistent interface pattern with standardized method signatures and error handling. All usages in the game engine have been updated.

## Recent Changes
- ‚úÖ Refactored FreeCells, Foundations, and Tableau to use consistent method signatures for `place_card`, `remove_card`, and `get_card`, with domain-specific error types.
- ‚úÖ Updated helper methods for counting and emptiness checks to be consistent across all three components.
- ‚úÖ Updated move execution and undo logic in `game_state/execution.rs` to use the new interfaces.
- ‚úÖ Updated tests to match the new signatures and error handling.
- ‚úÖ Updated root `.clinerules` with monorepo-specific navigation strategy
- ‚úÖ Created root `memory-bank/` directory structure
- ‚úÖ Implemented `projectbrief.md` with monorepo overview
- ‚úÖ Implemented `workspaceContext.md` with component relationships
- ‚úÖ Implemented `activeContext.md` with current priorities
- ‚úÖ Implemented `progress.md` with workspace-wide status
- ‚úÖ Optimized component memory banks to focus on component-specific details
- ‚úÖ Moved workspace-wide concerns from components to root memory bank

## Next Steps
1. **Propagate Interface Consistency**
   - Ensure all consumers (e.g., solver, UI) use the new interfaces.
   - Update documentation and memory banks in all affected components.
2. **Begin Component Development**
   - Focus on game/ component implementation
   - Implement interactive FreeCell gameplay
   - Test new memory bank navigation strategy in practice
3. **Memory Bank Strategy Validation**
   - Verify navigation efficiency in real development scenarios
   - Fine-tune component memory banks based on usage patterns

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Memory Bank Navigation Strategy
**Decision Made**: Three-tier hierarchy approach
- **Tier 1**: Root memory bank for workspace overview
- **Tier 2**: Component memory banks for detailed context
- **Tier 3**: Navigation files (`.clinerules`, `WORKSPACE_GUIDE.md`)

**Context Loading Rules**:
- Component-specific work: Start with root `activeContext.md`, then component memory bank
- Cross-component work: Read entire root memory bank first
- Unknown scope: Always start with root `activeContext.md`

### Current Development Priority
**Active Component**: game/ (interactive FreeCell application)
- Building on established game-engine foundation
- Needs UI implementation in `src/main.rs`
- Priority: Complete basic gameplay loop

## Important Patterns and Preferences

### Monorepo Organization
- **Shared Library Pattern**: game-engine as foundation for all applications
- **Clear Boundaries**: Each component has focused responsibility
- **Workspace Consistency**: Unified build, test, and development patterns
- **Memory Bank Efficiency**: Avoid reading unnecessary context

### Development Approach
- **Component-First**: Focus on one component at a time when possible
- **Integration-Aware**: Consider cross-component impacts
- **Documentation-Driven**: Memory banks guide all development decisions
- **Iterative Progress**: Build working increments across components

## Learnings and Project Insights

### Monorepo Memory Bank Strategy
- **Context Overload Risk**: Reading all memory banks creates information overload
- **Navigation Importance**: Root `activeContext.md` serves as compass
- **Scope-Based Loading**: Different strategies for different work types
- **Consolidation Benefits**: Single `.clinerules` eliminates duplication

### Component Relationships
- **game-engine**: Stable foundation, affects all consumers
- **game**: Current development focus, needs UI implementation
- **solver**: Next priority after game completion
- **appAutomation**: Final integration phase

### Workspace Health
- ‚úÖ All components compile successfully
- ‚úÖ Shared library pattern working correctly
- ‚úÖ Clear dependency relationships established
- üîÑ Memory bank structure being optimized
- ‚è≥ Cross-component testing patterns needed

## Cross-Component Considerations

### API Stability
- Changes to game-engine require coordination across consumers
- Maintain backward compatibility when possible
- Document breaking changes clearly

### Integration Points
- **game + game-engine**: GameState, Move validation, game rules
- **solver + game-engine**: State validation, Move generation
- **solver + appAutomation**: Solution format compatibility

### Testing Strategy
- Component-level unit tests
- Integration tests through game-engine
- Workspace-wide build and compatibility tests

## Memory Bank Status

### Root Memory Bank - COMPLETE ‚úÖ
- ‚úÖ `projectbrief.md` - Monorepo vision and architecture
- ‚úÖ `workspaceContext.md` - Component relationships
- ‚úÖ `activeContext.md` - Current priorities and focus
- ‚úÖ `progress.md` - Workspace-wide status and roadmap

### Component Memory Banks - OPTIMIZED ‚úÖ
- ‚úÖ `/game-engine/memory-bank/` - Focused on library architecture and patterns
- ‚è≥ `/solver/memory-bank/` - To be created when needed

### Navigation Files - COMPLETE ‚úÖ
- ‚úÖ `/.clinerules` - Updated with monorepo strategy
- ‚úÖ `/WORKSPACE_GUIDE.md` - Technical workspace information
- ‚úÖ Removed duplicate `.clinerules` from components

## Notes for Future Sessions
- **Start Here**: Always read this file first to understand current focus
- **Component Work**: Check if work is component-specific or cross-component
- **Memory Bank Navigation**: Follow the established three-tier strategy
- **Current Priority**: Complete root memory bank, then focus on game/ component
- **Integration Awareness**: Consider cross-component impacts for all changes
