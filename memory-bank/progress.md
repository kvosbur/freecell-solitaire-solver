- **Game Logic**: Complete FreeCell rules and validation
- **Component Architecture**: Tableau, FreeCells, Foundations working
- **API**: Stable interface for consumer applications
- **Testing**: Core game logic tested and verified

#### solver/ (Algorithm Application) - SKELETON ‚è≥
- **Structure**: Basic Cargo.toml and main.rs created
- **Dependencies**: Configured to use game-engine
- **Status**: Algorithm implementation pending
- **Priority**: After game-engine refactoring

#### appAutomation/ (Mobile Integration) - PLANNED ‚è≥
- **Structure**: Directory exists
- **Status**: Implementation pending
- **Priority**: Final integration phase

### Development Environment
- **Cross-Platform**: Project builds on Linux environment
- **Code Quality**: Clippy, fmt, test available workspace-wide
- **Documentation**: Cargo doc generation works
- **Version Control**: Git repository properly configured
- **Memory Bank**: Consolidated .clinerules with monorepo strategy

## What's Left to Build üîÑ

### Root Memory Bank Completion
- ‚è≥ Remove duplicate .clinerules from components
- ‚è≥ Optimize component memory banks (remove workspace-wide content)
- ‚è≥ Verify navigation strategy works in practice

### Component Development Priorities

#### game-engine/ - Immediate Focus
- **API Refinement**: Implement v0.2.0 breaking changes (Enhanced Error System, Type-Safe Locations, Clean Move System, Focused GameState API, Component Interface Refinement)
- **Documentation Update**: Thoroughly update all API documentation
- **Testing**: Ensure comprehensive test coverage

#### solver/ - Next Priority
- **Algorithm Design**: Choose solving strategy (A*, BFS, etc.)
- **State Space Search**: Implement game tree exploration
- **Solution Output**: Format for consumption by other components
- **Performance Optimization**: Handle complex game states

#### appAutomation/ - Future Priority
- **Mobile Interface**: Connect to mobile FreeCell apps
- **Solution Input**: Consume solver output
- **Automation Logic**: Execute moves in mobile apps
- **Error Recovery**: Handle mobile app state changes

### Cross-Component Integration
- **Solution Format**: Standardize move sequences between solver and automation
- **Error Handling**: Consistent error patterns across components
- **Testing Strategy**: Integration tests through game-engine
- **API Stability**: Coordinate changes to shared interfaces

## Current Status üìä

### Workspace Completion
- **Infrastructure**: 95% ‚úÖ (memory bank optimization remaining)
- **game-engine**: 90% üîÑ (stable foundation, undergoing refactoring)
- **solver**: 5% ‚è≥ (skeleton only)
- **appAutomation**: 0% ‚è≥ (not started)

### Development Phase
**Phase**: Foundation ‚Üí Component Implementation
- Shared foundation is stable and ready
- Primary focus on game/ component
- Clear roadmap for remaining components

## Known Issues üêõ

### Memory Bank Structure
- **Duplicate Files**: .clinerules files in components need removal
- **Content Overlap**: Some workspace concerns in component memory banks
- **Navigation Testing**: New strategy needs practical verification

### Component Issues

#### game-engine/
- **API Refinement**: Breaking changes for v0.2.0 are in progress.

#### solver/
- **Algorithm Selection**: Need to choose and implement solving approach
- **Performance Concerns**: Complex game states may require optimization

#### Cross-Component
- **Integration Patterns**: Need to establish communication standards
- **Testing Coverage**: Integration testing strategy needed

## Evolution of Project Decisions üìà

### Memory Bank Architecture
- **‚úÖ Three-Tier Strategy**: Root + Component + Navigation - effective approach
- **‚úÖ Context Loading Rules**: Scope-based navigation - prevents overload
- **‚úÖ Single .clinerules**: Eliminates duplication - cleaner maintenance
- **üîÑ Component Optimization**: Removing workspace content from components

### Technical Architecture
- **‚úÖ Shared Library Pattern**: game-engine as foundation - working excellently
- **‚úÖ Workspace Organization**: Clear component boundaries - effective
- **‚úÖ Rust 2021**: Modern language features - good choice
- **‚è≥ Integration Patterns**: Cross-component communication needs design

### Development Approach
- **‚úÖ Documentation-First**: Memory bank system - very effective
- **‚úÖ Component-First**: Focus on one component at a time - efficient
- **‚úÖ Foundation-First**: Stable game-engine before applications - successful
- **üîÑ Iterative Implementation**: Building working increments
