# Freecell Webapp Requirements Questionnaire

## 1. Visual Design & UI
- Do you want a classic Freecell look, or a modern/custom design?
A simple design is best so we can minimize the support images needed.

- Should the app be mobile-friendly/responsive?
No, that's not necessary. It would be nice to have.

- Any color scheme or branding preferences?
I like dinosaurs. Dinosaur branding is big plus. But not neccesary.

## 2. Game Features
- Should the app support only single-player, or multiplayer as well?
Single player only.

- Do you want features like undo/redo, hints, or auto-move to foundations?
Undo would be great. Redo is not necessary. Auto-move is not necessary.

- Should the app track stats (wins, moves, time, etc.)?
We'd like it to keep track of which game seeds we've successfully solved.

## 3. Game Rules
- Use standard Freecell rules, or any custom variations?
Standard rules.

- Should the user be able to select the number of freecells/tableau piles?
No. But, they should be able to enter the game seed (or play a random game).

## 4. Technology Preferences
- Do you have a preferred frontend framework (React, Vue, Svelte, plain JS, etc.)?
React please.

- Should the app be a static site, or do you want a backend (for saving games, user accounts, etc.)?
Static site.

## 5. Deployment & Integration
- Where do you plan to host the app (GitHub Pages, Vercel, Netlify, etc.)?
Localhost for now.

- Should the app integrate with your existing solver codebase, or be standalone?
Standalone.

## 6. Accessibility & Internationalization
- Should the app be accessible (screen reader support, keyboard navigation)?
Yes, screen reader support and keyboard navigation would be great.

- Any language/localization requirements?
No, US English only for now.

## 7. Additional Features
- Do you want sound effects, animations, or other enhancements?
No.

- Should users be able to share games or scores?
No.
