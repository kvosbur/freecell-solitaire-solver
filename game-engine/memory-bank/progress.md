# progress.md

**Purpose:**  
Tracks what works, what's left to build, current status, known issues, and the evolution of project decisions. This file provides a running log of project progress and outstanding work.

## What Works

- **This project is a robust, reusable FreeCell game engine library crate (not a full game app).**
- `game_state` is now modularized into submodules (`mod.rs`, `error.rs`, `validation.rs`, `moves.rs`, `execution.rs`), with private helpers for validation, unified error handling, and comprehensive documentation.
- All core FreeCell movement and placement rules are implemented in Rust, fully tested with TDD:
  - Tableau stacking (alternating color, descending rank)
  - Foundation stacking (same suit, ascending rank)
  - Free cell placement (only empty cells)
  - Empty tableau column placement (any card)
  - Foundation immutability (cards cannot be moved from foundation)
- Modular, idiomatic Rust code with clear separation of concerns.
- `GameState` struct models the board, freecells, tableau, and foundations.
- Move validation and execution logic is complete.
- Game state inspection API: win detection, available moves, etc.
- 50+ parameterized and unit tests pass, covering all rule logic and state transitions.
- Library is ready for integration with UIs, AI solvers, or other applications via its public API.
- **New**: A comprehensive API review has confirmed the game engine's excellent adherence to Rust best practices. The current API is robust and functional.

## What's Left to Build

- **Next Major Version (v0.2.0) API Refinement**:
    - **Enhanced Error System**: Implement a rich `GameError` that preserves full context from component-specific errors (e.g., `FreeCellError`, `FoundationError`, `TableauError`).
    - **Type-Safe Locations**: Introduce a validated `Location` struct for all game areas, ensuring type safety and preventing invalid indices at construction.
    - **Clean Move System**: Redesign the `Move` struct to be type-safe and focused solely on game mechanics (source, destination, card count), removing any solver-specific metadata.
    - **Focused GameState API**: Streamline the `GameState` API, ensuring all methods are core to game rules and mechanics, and provide consistent `Result`-based return types for all fallible operations. This includes methods for `execute_move`, `validate_move`, `get_available_moves`, and basic state queries.
    - **Component Interface Refinement**: Ensure all component methods (`Tableau`, `FreeCells`, `Foundations`) consistently return `Result` for all fallible operations, providing consistent error handling.
- Deck creation and shuffling logic.
- Standard FreeCell deal algorithm (Microsoft-compatible).
- Seed-based reproducible deals for testing/solvers.
- Save/load functionality (serialization/deserialization).
- Features such as undo/redo, auto-move to foundations, and state history (these will be implemented on top of the refined core engine, potentially in separate crates if they involve strategy/UI).
- Continue writing tests and examples to support learning and code quality.

## Current Status

- The FreeCell game engine library crate is complete and fully tested for core logic.
- All core logic, move system, and state inspection APIs are implemented.
- The API has been thoroughly reviewed and is deemed excellent, but a decision has been made to introduce breaking changes in the next major version (v0.2.0) to further refine its purity and focus.
- Ready for integration into a UI, solver, or other application, with the understanding that the API will undergo a significant, but beneficial, overhaul.
- Next: Implementation of the v0.2.0 API changes, followed by deck/deal logic.

## Known Issues

- The current API, while functional, can be improved for consistency and clarity, especially in error handling and return types, which will be addressed in v0.2.0.
- Implementing the Microsoft FreeCell deal algorithm may require research to ensure perfect compatibility.
- Ensuring API clarity and extensibility for downstream consumers remains a priority, especially with the new architectural decision to strictly separate concerns.

## Evolution of Project Decisions

- Chose Rust for its learning value, safety, and performance.
- Decided to focus on a reusable game engine library crate, not a full game app.
- Emphasized modular architecture and idiomatic Rust patterns from the outset.
- Documentation-first and TDD approach adopted to ensure clarity, maintainability, and correctness.
- **New Architectural Decision**: The `game-engine` crate will strictly adhere to core FreeCell game rules and mechanics. Features related to solver heuristics, game analysis, or UI-specific logic will be explicitly excluded from this crate and developed in separate, higher-level crates that depend on `game-engine`. This ensures a pure, focused, and highly reusable core library, justifying the upcoming breaking changes for a cleaner API.
