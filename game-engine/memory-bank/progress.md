# progress.md

**Purpose:**  
Tracks what works, what's left to build, current status, known issues, and the evolution of project decisions. This file provides a running log of project progress and outstanding work.

---

## What Works

- ✅ **Pure Game Engine**: The library is a pure, robust, and reusable FreeCell game engine with no UI or solver-specific logic.
- ✅ **Core Game Logic**: All FreeCell rules, move validation, and execution are fully implemented and tested.
- ✅ **State Management**: `GameState` and all components (`Tableau`, `FreeCells`, `Foundations`) are fully functional and modularized.
- ✅ **Type-Safe Locations**: The `Location` system with validated `TableauLocation`, `FreecellLocation`, and `FoundationLocation` is implemented, preventing invalid index errors.
- ✅ **Standardized Component Interfaces**: All components (`Tableau`, `FreeCells`, `Foundations`) share a consistent API for `place_card`, `remove_card`, and `get_card`.
- ✅ **Rich Error System**: A solid error handling foundation is in place, with `GameError` wrapping component-specific errors to provide context.
- ✅ **Comprehensive Testing**: 50+ parameterized and unit tests ensure correctness and rule adherence.
- ✅ **Excellent Documentation**: The entire public API is documented with examples.

## What's Left to Build

- **Consumer Readiness Refinements (v0.2.0)**:
    - **Standardize API Return Types**: Refactor all fallible operations to consistently return `Result<T, Error>` instead of a mix of `Result` and `Option`.
    - **Simplify Error Handling**: Make the `GameError` enum more ergonomic and easier for consumers to handle.
    - **Streamline Move Construction**: Introduce a builder pattern or convenience methods for `Move` to improve usability.
    - **Clean Up API Surface**: Consolidate dual APIs (index-based vs. location-based) and remove unused features like `card_count` from `Move`.
- **Consumer-Focused Documentation**:
    - Add a "Getting Started" guide for library consumers.
    - Provide clear migration notes for v0.2.0 breaking changes.
    - Include end-to-end integration examples.
- **Core Engine Features**:
    - Deck creation and Microsoft-compatible shuffling algorithm.
    - Seed-based reproducible deals.

## Current Status

- **v0.1.0 - Core Engine**: ✅ **COMPLETE**. The engine is fully functional, tested, and documented. It is ready for integration by consumers who are aware of the upcoming API refinements.
- **v0.2.0 - Consumer Readiness**: ⏳ **IN PROGRESS**. The focus is now on refining the API to make it a stellar example of a consumable Rust library.
- **Next**: Implement the targeted API refinements for v0.2.0.

## Known Issues

- The current API, while functional, can be improved for consistency and clarity, especially in error handling and return types, which will be addressed in v0.2.0.
- Implementing the Microsoft FreeCell deal algorithm may require research to ensure perfect compatibility.
- Ensuring API clarity and extensibility for downstream consumers remains a priority, especially with the new architectural decision to strictly separate concerns.

## Evolution of Project Decisions

- Chose Rust for its learning value, safety, and performance.
- Decided to focus on a reusable game engine library crate, not a full game app.
- Emphasized modular architecture and idiomatic Rust patterns from the outset.
- Documentation-first and TDD approach adopted to ensure clarity, maintainability, and correctness.
- **New Architectural Decision**: The `game-engine` crate will strictly adhere to core FreeCell game rules and mechanics. Features related to solver heuristics, game analysis, or UI-specific logic will be explicitly excluded from this crate and developed in separate, higher-level crates that depend on `game-engine`. This ensures a pure, focused, and highly reusable core library, justifying the upcoming breaking changes for a cleaner API.
