# progress.md

**Purpose:**  
Tracks what works, what's left to build, current status, known issues, and the evolution of project decisions. This file provides a running log of project progress and outstanding work.

---

## What Works

- **This project is a robust, reusable FreeCell game engine library crate (not a full game app).**
- All core FreeCell movement and placement rules are implemented in Rust, fully tested with TDD:
  - Tableau stacking (alternating color, descending rank)
  - Foundation stacking (same suit, ascending rank)
  - Free cell placement (only empty cells)
  - Empty tableau column placement (any card)
  - Foundation immutability (cards cannot be moved from foundation)
- Modular, idiomatic Rust code with clear separation of concerns.
- `GameState` struct models the board, freecells, tableau, and foundations.
- Move validation and execution logic is complete.
- Game state inspection API: win detection, available moves, etc.
- 50+ parameterized and unit tests pass, covering all rule logic and state transitions.
- Library is ready for integration with UIs, AI solvers, or other applications via its public API.

## What's Left to Build

- Deck creation and shuffling logic.
- Standard FreeCell deal algorithm (Microsoft-compatible).
- Seed-based reproducible deals for testing/solvers.
- API enhancements for integration with UIs and solvers.
- Save/load functionality (serialization/deserialization).
- Features such as undo/redo, auto-move to foundations, and state history.
- Continue writing tests and examples to support learning and code quality.

## Current Status

- The FreeCell game engine library crate is complete and fully tested for core logic.
- All core logic, move system, and state inspection APIs are implemented.
- Ready for integration into a UI, solver, or other application.
- Next: Add deck/deal logic and expand API for integration and advanced features.

## Known Issues

- Implementing the Microsoft FreeCell deal algorithm may require research to ensure perfect compatibility.
- Potential challenges include ensuring API clarity and extensibility for downstream consumers.

## Evolution of Project Decisions

- Chose Rust for its learning value, safety, and performance.
- Decided to focus on a reusable game engine library crate, not a full game app.
- Emphasized modular architecture and idiomatic Rust patterns from the outset.
- Documentation-first and TDD approach adopted to ensure clarity, maintainability, and correctness.
