# activeContext.md

**Purpose:**  
Tracks the current work focus, recent changes, next steps, active decisions and considerations, important patterns and preferences, and key learnings and project insights. This file is updated frequently to reflect the evolving state of the project.

---

## Current Work Focus

- The project is a robust, reusable FreeCell game engine library crate (not a full game app).
- All core logic, move validation/execution, and state inspection APIs are implemented and tested.
- The engine is designed for integration with UIs, solvers, and other applications, with no direct user interface or I/O.
- Focus is on providing a clean, well-documented API and preparing for downstream integration.
- **Recent focus:** Interface consistency refactor for `FreeCells`, `Foundations`, and `Tableau` to standardize method signatures and error handling across all core components.
- **Current Focus**: Production-ready. The game-engine is stable, well-documented, and ready for integration with consumer applications like the solver and appAutomation.

## Recent Changes

- ✅ **Completed Comprehensive Review**: Thoroughly analyzed the entire `game-engine` crate against purity, Rust conventions, API usability, and documentation quality.
- ✅ **Confirmed Pure Engine Design**: Verified that the engine contains no UI or solver-specific logic and has a clean separation of concerns.
- ✅ **Validated Rust Best Practices**: Confirmed strong adherence to idiomatic Rust, including robust error handling, type safety, and memory safety.
- ✅ **Implemented Type-Safe Locations**: The `Location` system with validated `TableauLocation`, `FreecellLocation`, and `FoundationLocation` is fully implemented and in use.
- ✅ **Standardized Component Interfaces**: `Tableau`, `FreeCells`, and `Foundations` all implement consistent `place_card`, `remove_card`, and `get_card` methods.
- ✅ **Established Rich Error System**: A solid foundation for error handling is in place with `GameError` wrapping component-specific errors.

## Next Steps

- **Maintenance Mode**: Address any bugs or performance issues that arise.
- **Support Integration**: Provide support for the solver and appAutomation components as they integrate with the game-engine.

## Active Decisions & Considerations

- **Priority**: Make the `game-engine` a stellar example of a consumable Rust library.
- **API Stability**: Breaking changes for v0.2.0 are approved to achieve a cleaner, more ergonomic API. All changes must be clearly documented.
- **Developer Experience**: The primary goal is to make the engine easy and intuitive for other developers to use.
- **Purity**: Continue to strictly enforce the separation of concerns, keeping the engine focused on core game logic.
- **Architectural Decision**: The `game-engine` crate will remain the authoritative source for FreeCell rules. All higher-level features (solvers, UIs) will be built in separate crates.

## Important Patterns & Preferences

- Modular code organization (separation of game logic from UI and input).
- Use of state and command patterns for game state management and user actions.
- Consistent use of Rust best practices (clippy, rustfmt, documentation).
- Parameterized testing with rstest for comprehensive rule validation.

## Learnings & Project Insights

- Comprehensive documentation at the outset provides clarity and direction.
- Defining architecture and patterns early helps guide future development and learning.
- TDD ensures correctness and confidence in rule logic.
- Rust's ecosystem (Cargo, clippy, rustfmt) supports maintainable and high-quality code.
- **Interface consistency across components greatly improves maintainability and integration.**
- **New Insight**: Maintaining a strict separation of concerns, especially between core game logic and higher-level application-specific features (like solvers or advanced analysis), is crucial for building a truly reusable and maintainable game engine. Breaking changes are justified when they lead to a significantly cleaner and more focused API.
