# Memory Bank: FreeCell Game Project

This memory bank provides comprehensive documentation for the FreeCell solitaire game project, ensuring continuity across development sessions.

## Core Files Overview

### 📋 Foundation Documents
- **`projectbrief.md`** - Project mission, requirements, and constraints
- **`productContext.md`** - User experience goals and product vision
- **`systemPatterns.md`** - Architecture patterns and design decisions
- **`techContext.md`** - Technology stack and implementation details

### 🎯 Active Development
- **`activeContext.md`** - Current work focus and immediate priorities
- **`progress.md`** - Development status, completed work, and next steps

## Quick Reference

### Project Status
- **Phase**: Foundation → Interface Implementation
- **Current Focus**: Implementing playable game interface
- **Next Priority**: Choose CLI/TUI/GUI approach and implement display system

### Key Architecture
- **Language**: Rust 2021 Edition
- **Structure**: Cargo workspace with shared game engine
- **Current App**: `game/` - Interactive FreeCell application
- **Dependencies**: `freecell-game-engine` (local path dependency)

### Development Commands
```bash
# Build and run the game
cargo run --bin game

# Build entire workspace
cargo build --workspace

# Run tests
cargo test --workspace
```

## Memory Bank Usage

### For New Sessions
1. **Always read ALL memory bank files** at the start of any task
2. **Start with `projectbrief.md`** for project foundation
3. **Check `activeContext.md`** for current work focus
4. **Review `progress.md`** for status and next steps

### For Updates
- Update `activeContext.md` when work focus changes
- Update `progress.md` when significant progress is made
- Update other files when architectural decisions change
- Use **"update memory bank"** command to trigger comprehensive review

## Current Development State

### ✅ Completed
- Project infrastructure and workspace setup
- Game engine integration and basic initialization
- Comprehensive memory bank documentation
- Development roadmap and technical decisions

### 🔄 In Progress
- Game interface implementation (main.rs needs work)

### ⏳ Next Steps
1. Choose interface approach (CLI recommended for start)
2. Implement game state display system
3. Add user input processing and move parsing
4. Create main game loop for continuous play

The memory bank is complete and ready to guide development. The project has a solid foundation and clear path forward to creating a playable FreeCell game.
