# Active Context: Current Development Focus

## Current Work Focus
**Primary Task**: Initialize memory bank for FreeCell solitaire game project

**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETED** - Memory bank successfully initialized with all core files

## Recent Changes
- Created `memory-bank/` directory structure
- Implemented all core memory bank files:
  - ✅ `projectbrief.md` - Project foundation and requirements
  - ✅ `productContext.md` - User experience and product goals
  - ✅ `systemPatterns.md` - Architecture and design patterns
  - ✅ `techContext.md` - Technical stack and implementation details
  - ✅ `activeContext.md` - Current file being created
  - ⏳ `progress.md` - Next to be created

## Next Steps
1. **Complete Memory Bank Initialization**
   - Create `progress.md` to document current project status
   - Verify all memory bank files are properly structured

2. **Ready for Development Work**
   - Memory bank will serve as foundation for all future development
   - Next development focus should be implementing the game interface in `src/main.rs`

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Interface Implementation Strategy
**Decision Pending**: Choose interface type for game application
- **Option 1**: CLI (Command Line Interface) - Fastest to implement
- **Option 2**: TUI (Terminal User Interface) - Better UX, moderate complexity
- **Option 3**: GUI (Graphical User Interface) - Best UX, highest complexity

**Recommendation**: Start with CLI for rapid prototyping, then evaluate upgrade to TUI

### Architecture Insights
- Workspace pattern is working well for multi-crate organization
- Game engine separation provides clean abstraction
- Current `main.rs` has good foundation but needs actual interface implementation

## Important Patterns and Preferences

### Code Organization
- Keep game logic in `game-engine` crate
- Applications focus on user interface and experience
- Use Rust's Result<T, E> pattern for error handling
- Maintain workspace consistency across all crates

### Development Approach
- Iterative development with working increments
- Test-driven development for game logic
- Clear separation of concerns between layers
- Documentation-first approach for complex features

## Learnings and Project Insights

### Project Structure Understanding
- This is part of a larger FreeCell solver ecosystem
- Game application is one of multiple workspace members
- Shared game engine ensures consistency across applications
- Current focus is on making the game playable

### Technical Insights
- Rust workspace pattern provides excellent code organization
- Game state management is well-architected in the engine
- Move system is comprehensive and type-safe
- Ready for interface implementation

### Development Environment
- Cargo workspace provides unified build system
- Cross-platform compatibility is maintained
- Development tools (clippy, fmt, test) work across workspace
- Git repository is properly configured

## Context for Future Development

### Immediate Priorities
1. **Game Interface**: Implement playable interface in `src/main.rs`
2. **User Experience**: Create intuitive command system
3. **Game Loop**: Implement continuous play until completion
4. **Error Handling**: Provide clear feedback for invalid moves

### Integration Points
- Game engine API is stable and ready to use
- Move system provides comprehensive game actions
- Game state management handles all FreeCell rules
- Win detection is built into the engine

### Quality Standards
- All code should follow Rust best practices
- Error handling should be comprehensive and user-friendly
- Interface should be intuitive and responsive
- Documentation should be clear and complete

## Memory Bank Status
- **Core Files**: All created and properly structured
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive coverage of project context
- **Architecture**: Well-documented patterns and relationships
- **Technical Details**: Complete technology stack documentation
- **Ready for Development**: Memory bank provides solid foundation

## Notes for Future Sessions
- Memory bank is now complete and ready to guide development
- Next major task should be implementing the game interface
- All architectural decisions are documented and ready to reference
- Project structure and patterns are well-established
