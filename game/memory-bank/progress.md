# Progress: FreeCell Game Development Status

## What Works ‚úÖ

### Project Infrastructure
- **Workspace Setup**: Rust workspace properly configured with multiple crates
- **Build System**: Cargo build/test/run commands work across entire workspace
- **Game Engine Integration**: Game application successfully imports and uses game engine
- **Memory Bank**: Complete documentation system established for project continuity

### Game Engine Foundation
- **Core Types**: `GameState`, `Card`, `Suit` types are defined and accessible
- **Component Architecture**: Tableau, FreeCells, and Foundations components are structured
- **Move System**: Comprehensive move types defined for all FreeCell actions
- **Game Initialization**: `GameState::new()` creates proper initial state

### Development Environment
- **Cross-Platform**: Project builds and runs on Linux (current environment)
- **Code Quality Tools**: Clippy, fmt, and test commands available
- **Documentation**: Cargo doc generation works for workspace
- **Version Control**: Git repository properly configured

## What's Left to Build üîÑ

### Game Interface (Primary Focus)
- **Display System**: Visual representation of game state
  - Tableau columns display
  - FreeCells status display
  - Foundations status display
  - Current game statistics

- **Input System**: User command parsing and processing
  - Move command syntax (e.g., "t1f" for tableau to freecell)
  - Input validation and error messages
  - Help system for available commands

- **Game Loop**: Continuous gameplay until completion
  - Main game loop with input/display cycle
  - Move execution and state updates
  - Win/lose condition handling
  - Game restart functionality

### Enhanced Features (Future)
- **Undo/Redo**: Move history and reversal capability
- **Hint System**: Show available moves to help players
- **Statistics**: Track games played, won, time taken
- **Save/Load**: Game state persistence
- **Custom Deals**: Play specific numbered FreeCell deals

### Interface Upgrades (Optional)
- **TUI Implementation**: Terminal-based visual interface
- **GUI Implementation**: Full graphical user interface
- **Mouse Support**: Click-based move input
- **Animations**: Smooth card movement effects

## Current Status üìä

### Completion Estimates
- **Project Infrastructure**: 100% ‚úÖ
- **Game Engine Integration**: 90% ‚úÖ (basic integration complete)
- **Game Interface**: 5% üîÑ (skeleton only, needs full implementation)
- **User Experience**: 0% ‚è≥ (not started)
- **Advanced Features**: 0% ‚è≥ (not started)

### Development Phase
**Phase**: Foundation ‚Üí Interface Implementation
- Foundation work is complete
- Ready to begin interface development
- Clear path forward established

## Known Issues üêõ

### Current Limitations
- **No Playable Interface**: Game runs but doesn't provide interactive gameplay
- **Missing Display Logic**: Game state is not visually represented
- **No Input Processing**: User cannot make moves
- **No Game Loop**: Application exits immediately after initialization

### Technical Debt
- **TODO Comments**: Several TODO items in `src/main.rs` need implementation
- **Error Handling**: Need comprehensive error handling for user input
- **Testing**: Interface code will need thorough testing
- **Documentation**: Interface implementation will need documentation

## Evolution of Project Decisions üìà

### Architecture Decisions
- **‚úÖ Workspace Pattern**: Chosen for multi-crate organization - working well
- **‚úÖ Shared Game Engine**: Provides consistency across applications - successful
- **‚úÖ Component Separation**: Clean separation of concerns - effective
- **‚è≥ Interface Type**: CLI vs TUI vs GUI decision still pending

### Technical Decisions
- **‚úÖ Rust 2021**: Modern language features and patterns - good choice
- **‚úÖ Result-Based Errors**: Comprehensive error handling pattern - appropriate
- **‚úÖ Local Dependencies**: Path-based dependencies for workspace - working well
- **‚è≥ Display Format**: Text representation format needs design

### Development Approach
- **‚úÖ Documentation-First**: Memory bank system established - very helpful
- **‚úÖ Iterative Development**: Step-by-step implementation - effective
- **‚úÖ Test-Driven**: Plan for comprehensive testing - good practice
- **‚è≥ Interface Strategy**: Need to choose CLI/TUI/GUI approach

## Next Development Priorities üéØ

### Immediate (Next Session)
1. **Choose Interface Type**: Decide between CLI, TUI, or GUI approach
2. **Implement Display System**: Show current game state to user
3. **Basic Input Processing**: Parse simple move commands
4. **Minimal Game Loop**: Allow basic gameplay

### Short Term (1-2 Sessions)
1. **Complete CLI Interface**: Full command-line gameplay
2. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive user feedback
3. **Move Validation**: Clear feedback for invalid moves
4. **Win Detection**: Proper game completion handling

### Medium Term (3-5 Sessions)
1. **Enhanced Display**: Better formatting and visual clarity
2. **Help System**: Command reference and game rules
3. **Undo/Redo**: Move history functionality
4. **Statistics**: Basic game tracking

### Long Term (Future)
1. **TUI Upgrade**: Consider terminal-based visual interface
2. **Advanced Features**: Hints, custom deals, save/load
3. **Integration**: Connect with solver for automated solutions
4. **Mobile Automation**: Interface with mobile app automation
