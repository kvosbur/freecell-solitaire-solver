# Product Context: FreeCell Solitaire Game

## Problem Statement
FreeCell solitaire is a popular card game that requires strategic thinking and planning. While many digital versions exist, there's value in creating a comprehensive solution that not only provides an interactive game experience but can also solve games automatically and integrate with existing mobile applications.

## Target Users

### Primary Users
- **FreeCell Enthusiasts**: Players who enjoy the strategic challenge of FreeCell
- **Puzzle Solvers**: Users who want to see optimal solutions to challenging deals
- **Mobile Game Players**: Users who play FreeCell on mobile apps and want assistance

### Secondary Users
- **Developers**: Those interested in game AI and solving algorithms
- **Researchers**: People studying game theory and optimization algorithms

## User Experience Goals

### Game Application (Current Focus)
The interactive game should provide:

1. **Intuitive Interface**: Easy-to-understand game board representation
2. **Clear Feedback**: Visual indication of valid moves and game state
3. **Progressive Difficulty**: Start with easier deals, progress to harder ones
4. **Educational Value**: Show why moves are valid/invalid, teach strategy
5. **Performance**: Responsive gameplay without lag

### Interface Options to Consider
- **CLI (Command Line Interface)**: Text-based, good for initial development
- **TUI (Terminal User Interface)**: Enhanced terminal experience with better visuals
- **GUI (Graphical User Interface)**: Full graphical interface for best user experience

## Core Game Features

### Essential Features

### Advanced Features
- Hint system (show possible moves)
- Auto-complete when game is clearly winnable
- Statistics tracking (games played, won, time taken)
- Custom deal input (play specific numbered deals)
- Solution replay (watch optimal solution)

## Integration Points

### Game Engine Integration
- Use shared `freecell-game-engine` library for all game logic
- Ensure consistency with solver and automation components
- Maintain clean separation between game logic and interface

## Current Implementation Status
The game application currently exists as a basic skeleton that:
- Initializes the game engine
- Demonstrates basic component access
- Shows example card creation
- Has placeholder for actual interface implementation

The next major step is implementing the actual game interface to make it playable.
