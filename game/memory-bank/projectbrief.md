# Project Brief: Interactive FreeCell Game

## Component Mission
Provide an interactive, user-friendly FreeCell solitaire game that demonstrates the capabilities of the shared game-engine library.

## Component Focus
The `game/` component is an interactive FreeCell application that:
- Uses the shared game-engine library for all game logic
- Provides a user interface for playing FreeCell
- Serves as a reference implementation for game-engine integration
- Offers an enjoyable gameplay experience

## Key Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- **Interactive Gameplay**: Allow users to play complete FreeCell games
- **Move Validation**: Provide clear feedback for valid/invalid moves
- **Game Display**: Show current game state clearly and intuitively
- **Win Detection**: Recognize and celebrate game completion
- **Game Management**: Support starting new games and restarting current games

### Technical Requirements
- **Game Engine Integration**: Use freecell-game-engine for all game logic
- **User Interface**: Implement CLI interface (with potential for TUI/GUI upgrade)
- **Error Handling**: Provide helpful feedback for user errors
- **Performance**: Responsive interface with immediate feedback

## Success Criteria
1. Users can play complete FreeCell games from start to finish
2. All moves are validated using game-engine rules
3. Interface is intuitive and provides clear feedback
4. Game state is displayed clearly and updates correctly
5. Win conditions are detected and celebrated appropriately

## Current Status
- ‚úÖ Basic application structure established
- ‚úÖ Game engine integration configured
- ‚úÖ Cargo.toml dependencies set up correctly
- üîÑ User interface implementation needed in src/main.rs
- ‚è≥ Display system for game state
- ‚è≥ Input parsing and command system
- ‚è≥ Game loop implementation

## Interface Design Considerations
- **CLI First**: Start with command-line interface for rapid development
- **Command System**: Simple, memorable commands for moves (e.g., "t1f" for tableau to freecell)
- **Clear Display**: ASCII representation of game state
- **Help System**: Built-in help for commands and game rules
- **Future Upgrades**: Design with TUI/GUI upgrades in mind
