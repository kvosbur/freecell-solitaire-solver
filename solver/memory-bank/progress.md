**Purpose:**  
Tracks what works, what's left to build, current status, known issues, and the evolution of project decisions for the solver component.

---

## What Works

- Skeleton structure for the solver component is in place (Cargo.toml, main.rs, initial modules).
- Dependency on game-engine is configured.
- Ready to implement solving algorithms using the standardized interfaces from game-engine.

## What's Left to Build

- Implement initial solving algorithm (e.g., BFS, A*, or IDA*).
- Define and document the solution output format for integration with other components.
- Add unit and integration tests to verify solver correctness and integration with game-engine.
- Expand with additional solving strategies and performance optimizations.
- Document all algorithms and integration points.

## Current Status

- The solver is in the initial setup phase.
- No solving algorithms implemented yet.
- Awaiting interface propagation from game-engine for all state operations.

## Known Issues

- No known issues at this stage; implementation and integration challenges may arise as development progresses.

## Evolution of Project Decisions

- Decided to use only game-engine APIs for all game logic to ensure consistency and maintainability.
- Chose to design the solver for extensibility, allowing for new algorithms and heuristics to be added.
- Committed to maintaining clear separation between solving logic, state management, and output formatting.
