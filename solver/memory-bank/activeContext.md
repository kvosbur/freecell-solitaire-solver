**Purpose:**  
Tracks the current work focus, recent changes, next steps, active decisions and considerations, important patterns and preferences, and key learnings and project insights for the solver component.

---

## Current Work Focus

- **Optimization and Integration**: The solver is a high-performance, multi-strategy engine for finding FreeCell solutions. The current focus is on optimizing the existing strategies, improving the benchmarking harness, and preparing for integration with the `appAutomation` component.

## Recent Changes

- ✅ **Multi-Strategy Implementation**: Implemented five distinct solving strategies (strat1 through strat5), each with different performance characteristics.
- ✅ **Strategy Registry**: Created a dynamic strategy registry that allows for easy discovery and selection of solving algorithms.
- ✅ **CLI Interface**: Built a comprehensive command-line interface using `clap` for running the solver, selecting strategies, and configuring benchmarks.
- ✅ **Benchmarking Harness**: Developed a robust benchmarking system to test and compare the performance of different strategies.
- ✅ **Packed State Representation**: Implemented a memory-efficient packed state representation to reduce the memory footprint of the solver.
- ✅ **Game Preparation Module**: Created a `game_prep` module to prepare game states for solving.

## Next Steps

1.  **Performance Analysis**: Conduct a thorough performance analysis of each solving strategy to identify bottlenecks and areas for optimization.
2.  **appAutomation Integration**: Define the data format for solution output and begin integration with the `appAutomation` component.
3.  **CI/CD for Benchmarking**: Integrate the benchmarking harness into a CI/CD pipeline to track performance over time.
4.  **Expand Strategy Set**: Research and implement additional solving algorithms to expand the solver's capabilities.

## Active Decisions and Considerations

- **Solution Output Format**: The format for solver output must be standardized to ensure compatibility with `appAutomation`.
- **Performance vs. Complexity**: Balancing the performance of solving strategies with their implementation complexity is a key consideration.
- **Extensibility**: The solver architecture should remain extensible to allow for the easy addition of new strategies.

## Important Patterns and Preferences

- **Strategy Pattern**: The use of a strategy pattern with a central registry allows for a clean separation of concerns and easy extensibility.
- **CLI-Driven**: The solver is designed to be driven from the command line, making it suitable for scripting and automation.
- **Data-Driven Benchmarking**: The benchmarking harness is data-driven, allowing for consistent and repeatable performance testing.

## Learnings and Project Insights

- A multi-strategy approach provides flexibility in tackling different types of FreeCell deals.
- A robust benchmarking harness is essential for measuring and improving performance.
- A well-designed CLI can greatly improve the usability of a complex application.
