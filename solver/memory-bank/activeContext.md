# activeContext.md

**Purpose:**  
Tracks the current work focus, recent changes, next steps, active decisions and considerations, important patterns and preferences, and key learnings and project insights for the solver component.

---

## Current Work Focus

- Establishing the basic structure for the solver component as a Rust binary crate.
- Integrating the game-engine library for all game state validation and manipulation.
- Preparing to implement solving algorithms that use the new standardized interfaces from game-engine.

## Recent Changes

- Created initial skeleton for solver (Cargo.toml, main.rs, module structure).
- Configured dependency on game-engine.
- No solving algorithms implemented yet; awaiting interface propagation from game-engine.

## Next Steps

1. Implement basic solving algorithm (e.g., BFS or A*) using game-engine APIs.
2. Define and document the solution output format for integration with other components.
3. Add tests to verify solver correctness and integration with game-engine.
4. Expand with additional solving strategies and performance optimizations.

## Active Decisions and Considerations

- All game state operations will use the new standardized interfaces from game-engine (place_card, remove_card, get_card, etc.).
- Solution output must be compatible with appAutomation and other consumers.
- Maintain clear separation between solving logic and game state management.

## Important Patterns and Preferences

- Use idiomatic Rust and follow workspace conventions.
- Prioritize maintainability and extensibility for future strategies.
- Document all algorithms and integration points.

## Learnings and Project Insights

- Early integration with game-engine ensures consistency and reduces future refactoring.
- Standardized interfaces simplify solver implementation and testing.
